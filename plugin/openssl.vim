" openssl.vim version 3.2 2008 Noah Spurrier <noah@noah.org>
"
" == Edit OpenSSL encrypted files and turn Vim into a Password Safe! ==
"
" This plugin enables reading and writing of files encrypted using OpenSSL.
" The file must have the extension of one of the ciphers used by OpenSSL. For
" example:
"
"    .des3 .aes .bf .bfa .idea .cast .rc2 .rc4 .rc5 (.bfa is base64 ASCII
"    encoded blowfish.)
"
" This will turn off the swap file and the .viminfo log. The `openssl` command
" line tool must be in the path.
"
" == Install ==
"
" Put this in your plugin directory and Vim will automatically load it:
"
"    ~/.vim/plugin/openssl.vim
"
" You can start by editing an empty unencrypted file. Give it one of the
" extensions above. When you write the file you will be asked to give it a new
" password.
"
" == Simple Vim Password Safe ==
"
" If you edit any file named '.auth.bfa' (that's the full name, not just the
" extension) then this plugin will add folding features and an automatic quit
" timeout.
"
" Vim will quit automatically after 5 minutes of no typing activity (unless
" the file has been changed).
"
" This plugin will fold on wiki-style headlines in the following format:
"
"     == This is a headline ==
"
" Any notes under the headline will be inside the fold until the next headline
" is reached. The SPACE key will toggle a fold open and closed. The q key will
" quit Vim. Create the following example file named ~/.auth.bfa:
"
"     == Colo server ==
"
"     username: maryjane password: esydpm
"
"     == Office server ==
"
"     username: peter password: 4m4z1ng
"
" Then create this bash alias:
"
"     alias auth='view ~/.auth.bfa'
"
" Now you can view your password safe by typing 'auth'. When Vim starts all
" the password information will be hidden under the headlines. To view the
" password information put the cursor on the headline and press SPACE. When
" you write an encrypted file a backup will automatically be made.
"
" This plugin can also make a backup of an encrypted file before writing
" changes. This helps guard against the situation where you may edit a file
" and write changes with the wrong password. You can still go back to the
" previous backup version. The backup file will have the same name as the
" original file with .bak before the original extension. For example:
"
"     .auth.bfa  -->  .auth.bak.bfa
"
" To turn on backups put the following global definition in your .vimrc file:
"
"     let g:openssl_backup = 1
"
